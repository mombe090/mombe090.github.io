# Welcome to Our Multilingual Blog

We're excited to announce that our blog now supports multiple languages! You can now read our content in both **French** and **English**.

## What's New

- **Language Switcher**: Use the language toggle in the navigation to switch between French and English
- **Multilingual Content**: All new posts will be available in both languages
- **SEO Optimized**: Proper hreflang tags and language-specific meta data
- **Backward Compatible**: All existing French content remains accessible

## How It Works

Our multilingual system uses Jekyll's powerful templating system combined with custom plugins to provide:

1. **Automatic Language Detection**: The blog detects your browser language preference
2. **Language Persistence**: Your language choice is remembered across page visits
3. **Translation Links**: Easy navigation between language versions of the same content
4. **Localized UI**: Navigation menus and interface elements adapt to your selected language

## Getting Started

Use the language switcher in the top navigation to explore content in your preferred language. All new posts will include translation links to help you find the same content in other languages.

Happy reading! ðŸš€
