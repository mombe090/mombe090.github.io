# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will transform the existing French-only Jekyll blog into a multilingual blog supporting both French and English languages. The implementation will provide seamless language switching, maintain SEO optimization for both languages, and preserve the existing French content while enabling new English content creation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a blog visitor, I want to view content in my preferred language (French or English), so that I can understand and engage with the blog content effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the blog THEN the system SHALL detect their browser language preference and display content in the appropriate language (French or English)

2. IF the user's browser language is not French or English THEN the system SHALL default to French as the primary language

3. WHEN content is not available in the user's preferred language THEN the system SHALL display the content in the default language (French) with a notice

4. WHEN a user switches languages THEN the system SHALL maintain their language preference across page navigation using browser storage

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a blog visitor, I want to easily switch between French and English versions of the site, so that I can access content in my preferred language at any time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is on any page THEN the system SHALL display a language switcher component in the navigation area

2. WHEN a user clicks the language switcher THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the equivalent page in the selected language

3. IF an equivalent page does not exist in the target language THEN the system SHALL redirect to the homepage of the target language

4. WHEN switching languages THEN the system SHALL preserve the current page context when possible (e.g., same post in different language)

5. WHEN the language switcher is displayed THEN it SHALL show both language options with clear visual indicators (flags or language codes)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to write blog posts in both French and English, so that I can reach a broader audience and provide content in multiple languages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a new blog post THEN the system SHALL support specifying the language in the front matter

2. WHEN a post exists in multiple languages THEN the system SHALL link related language versions together

3. WHEN displaying a post THEN the system SHALL show available language alternatives with links to switch

4. WHEN a post is available in multiple languages THEN each version SHALL have its own URL structure (e.g., /fr/posts/title and /en/posts/title)

5. WHEN creating content THEN the system SHALL support language-specific metadata (title, description, tags) for SEO optimization

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a blog visitor, I want the site navigation, UI elements, and static content to be displayed in my selected language, so that I have a consistent localized experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a language THEN all navigation menus SHALL be displayed in the selected language

2. WHEN displaying UI elements THEN labels, buttons, and messages SHALL use the appropriate language translations

3. WHEN showing dates and times THEN they SHALL be formatted according to the selected language's locale conventions

4. WHEN displaying categories and tags THEN they SHALL be translated or displayed in the appropriate language context

5. WHEN showing error messages or notifications THEN they SHALL appear in the user's selected language

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a search engine, I want to properly index content in both languages with appropriate hreflang tags, so that I can serve the correct language version to users in search results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating pages THEN the system SHALL include proper hreflang tags for all language versions

2. WHEN a page exists in multiple languages THEN each version SHALL reference all other language versions via hreflang

3. WHEN generating sitemaps THEN the system SHALL create language-specific sitemaps or include language annotations

4. WHEN serving pages THEN the system SHALL include appropriate lang attributes in HTML elements

5. WHEN generating meta tags THEN language-specific Open Graph and Twitter Card tags SHALL be included

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a blog administrator, I want to maintain the existing French content and URLs without breaking existing links, so that SEO rankings and user bookmarks remain functional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing multilingual support THEN all existing French URLs SHALL continue to work without redirects

2. WHEN accessing legacy French URLs THEN the content SHALL display correctly with proper language context

3. WHEN search engines crawl existing URLs THEN they SHALL receive the same content with updated multilingual metadata
